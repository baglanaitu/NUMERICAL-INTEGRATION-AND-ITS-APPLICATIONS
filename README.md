# NUMERICAL-INTEGRATION-AND-ITS-APPLICATIONS
Most integrals cannot be evaluated exactly. For such integrals, we instead have to
rely on numerical integration, also called quadrature1, to calculate an approximate
value for the integral. In practice, numerical integration is often used even for the
integrals that can be evaluated exactly. Numerical integration methods are simple
compared to exact methods, and can be efficient and highly accurate. They can
also be used to derive simple numerical methods for solving ordinary dierential
equations.
